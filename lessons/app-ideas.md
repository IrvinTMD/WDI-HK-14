# ideas for apps

Pretty much all of the functionality in the following suggestions has either been done in a standalone app or incorporated elsewhere. That's not the point of these app ideas. Your apps are showcases for the skills and knowledge you have gained on the WDI course - that's what you need to demonstrate to employers.

Also, this list is my list. I have a personal bias towards students making apps that are tools that help with development. By writing such apps you will automatically gain a greater understanding of the technology you're working with.

Remember, who made more money in the gold rush - the millions of panhandlers, or the folk who sold them the picks and shovels?

Anyway, these are suggestions. Feel free to ignore...

* Network analyser. Uses your coding language's wrapper for nmap, ping, traceroute, ifconfig etc to determine if your app doesn't work because of a problem with the netork layers underneath.
